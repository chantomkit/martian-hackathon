# 🛡️ Guardian-Loop: Mechanistically Interpretable Safety Judge

**Track 1 Submission** for the Apart x Martian Mechanistic Router Interpretability Hackathon

## 🎯 Overview

Guardian-Loop is a dual-judge system featuring lightweight, mechanistically interpretable safety judges with adversarial self-improvement. Our approach combines:

- **Lightweight Safety Judge**: Llama 3.1 8B with frozen layers and probe heads (~50MB additional parameters)
- **Deep Mechanistic Interpretability**: Token attribution, attention analysis, and circuit visualization
- **Rainbow Adversarial Loop**: Continuously discovers and patches vulnerabilities using MAP-Elites
- **Martian Integration**: Efficient pre-filtering for router systems with <10ms latency

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- 50GB disk space for models

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-team/guardian-loop.git
cd guardian-loop

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NLTK data (for adversarial mutations)
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

### Run the Complete Pipeline

```bash
# Run everything: data prep → training → testing → demo
python main.py --stage all

# Or run specific stages
python main.py --stage setup     # Setup environment
python main.py --stage data      # Prepare datasets
python main.py --stage train     # Train safety judge
python main.py --stage test      # Run adversarial testing
python main.py --stage demo      # Create demo package
```

### Quick Demo (Pre-trained Model)

```bash
# If you have a pre-trained model
python demo.py --mode all --model outputs/checkpoints/best_model.pt

# Or launch interactive Streamlit demo
streamlit run demo.py
```

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### 1. Safety Judge Architecture

```python
# Llama 3.1 8B base model
# Freeze first 24/32 layers
# Add lightweight probe head (256 → 128 → 2)
# Total trainable params: ~50MB
```

- **Base Model**: Llama 3.1 8B (frozen layers for efficiency)
- **Probe Design**: Two-layer MLP with dropout for safety classification
- **Training**: Only probe head is trained, preserving base model knowledge

### 2. Mechanistic Interpretability

We implement three key MI techniques:

1. **Token Attribution**: Integrated gradients to identify safety-triggering tokens
2. **Attention Analysis**: Identify which heads focus on safety patterns
3. **Circuit Visualization**: Compare activation paths for safe vs unsafe prompts

### 3. Rainbow Adversarial Loop

Based on Rainbow Teaming methodology:

```python
# MAP-Elites archive with 2D grid
Risk Categories × Evasion Techniques = 64 cells

# Biased sampling toward low-fitness regions
# Sequential mutations for targeted diversity
# Preference-based evaluation (not absolute scores)
```

### 4. Martian Integration

```python
# Pre-filter unsafe requests before expensive LLM calls
# Average latency: 5-10ms
# Cost savings: $0.02 per filtered request
# ROI: 2000%+ at scale
```

## 📚 Datasets Used

### Dataset Characteristics

Our safety judge is trained on multiple datasets, each with different labeling approaches:

| Dataset | What it Labels | Suitable for Prompt-Only Detection | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **ToxicChat** | User prompts | ✅ Yes | 10K real user prompts with toxicity labels |
| **JailbreakBench** | User prompts | ✅ Yes | Curated jailbreak attempts |
| **Real-Toxicity-Prompts** | User prompts | ✅ Yes | 99K prompts with continuous toxicity scores |
| **BeaverTails** | QA pairs | ⚠️ Limited | Labels entire interactions, not just prompts |
| **WildChat** | Conversations | ⚠️ Limited | Labels apply to full conversations |

### Important Note on BeaverTails

⚠️ **BeaverTails labels entire question-answer pairs**, not individual prompts. A potentially harmful prompt might be labeled as "safe" if the response adequately mitigates the harm. This dataset is designed for QA-moderation, not prompt-only toxicity detection. We use category labels as a proxy, but this is an approximation.

### Data Preparation

```bash
# Prepare safety datasets with proper filtering
python -m src.data.prepare_safety_data

# This will:
# - Load datasets optimized for prompt-only detection
# - Create balanced train/val/test splits
# - Generate safe mutations of unsafe prompts
# - Output to data/prepared/
```
