fig, data = visualizer.create_token_attribution_heatmap(
    "How do I protect my computer from hackers?",
    return_data=True
)
```

### Advanced Neuron Analysis
```python
from mi_tools import AdvancedSafetyAnalyzer

# Create analyzer
analyzer = AdvancedSafetyAnalyzer(model, tokenizer)

# Identify safety neurons
safety_neurons = analyzer.identify_safety_neurons(
    safe_prompts=["How to bake cookies?", ...],
    unsafe_prompts=["How to hack systems?", ...]
)

# Trace circuits
circuits = analyzer.trace_safety_circuits()
```
