## Abstract

We present Guardian-Loop, a novel approach to creating efficient, interpretable judge models for AI orchestration systems. Our dual-judge architecture combines a safety judge and a feasibility judge, each using only 20M parameters to pre-filter prompts before expensive LLM calls. The key innovation is our adversarial self-improvement loop: we continuously discover prompts that fool our judges, retrain on these hard cases, and use mechanistic interpretability to understand how the models adapt. In experiments using the Martian orchestration platform, Guardian-Loop achieves 93% AUROC for safety detection and 89% for feasibility assessment, while reducing API costs by 40-60%. Our mechanistic analysis reveals how safety judges learn to ignore excuse patterns and how feasibility judges identify knowledge boundaries. We demonstrate that small, specialized judges can be both highly effective and deeply interpretable when combined with continuous adversarial refinement.

## 1. Introduction

The rise of powerful language models has created new challenges for AI deployment:
- **Cost**: Routing every query to frontier models is expensive
- **Safety**: Not all prompts should receive responses
- **Quality**: Models often hallucinate on out-of-distribution queries
- **Interpretability**: Black-box routing decisions erode trust

Expert orchestration architectures [1] offer a solution by routing queries to specialized models, but require effective judge models to make routing decisions. We propose Guardian-Loop, a system of micro-judges that are:

1. **Efficient**: 20M parameters vs 175B+ for full models
2. **Interpretable**: Full mechanistic understanding of decisions
3. **Self-improving**: Adversarial examples enhance robustness
4. **Practical**: Direct integration with existing routers

Our key contributions:
- A dual-judge architecture separating safety from feasibility concerns
- An adversarial training loop that uses discovered blind spots for improvement
- Mechanistic interpretability analysis showing how judges make decisions
- Integration with the Martian orchestration platform demonstrating real-world impact

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Model Routing and Orchestration
Prior work on model routing [2,3] focuses on cost-performance tradeoffs but lacks interpretability. Martian's expert orchestration [4] provides infrastructure but requires effective judges.

### 2.2 Adversarial Training
Rainbow teaming [5] generates diverse adversarial prompts. We extend this by using adversarial examples for training, not just evaluation.

### 2.3 Mechanistic Interpretability
Recent MI work [6,7] reveals model internals. We apply these techniques to understand judge decisions and track learning.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dual-Judge Architecture

We train two complementary judges:

```python
class GuardianLoop(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model="gpt2"):
        super().__init__()
        # Shared frozen encoder
        self.encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(base_model)
        # self.freeze_encoder_layers(n=6)
        
        # Separate judge heads
        self.safety_head = nn.Linear(768, 2)      # Safe/Unsafe
        self.feasibility_head = nn.Linear(768, 2) # Feasible/Infeasible
        
        # MI hooks for analysis
        self.register_forward_hooks()
```

### 3.2 Dataset Curation

**Safety Judge Training Data:**
- Anthropic HH-RLHF (5k samples) 
- Jailbreak artifacts (2k samples)
- AdvBench adversarial prompts (1k)
- Generated adversarial (2k from our loop)

**Feasibility Judge Training Data:**
- TruthfulQA (3k) - hallucination detection
- HaluEval (2k) - specific hallucination types  
- MMLU subset (2k) - knowledge boundaries
- Natural Questions (2k) - answerability
- Generated adversarial (1k from our loop)

### 3.3 Adversarial Self-Improvement Loop

Our core innovation is using adversarial discovery for continuous improvement:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Generate mutations that fool current judges
2. **Labeling Phase**: Use Martian API to get ground truth
3. **Retraining Phase**: LoRA update on adversarial examples
4. **Analysis Phase**: MI techniques reveal what changed

1. **Token Attribution** via Integrated Gradients
2. **Attention Pattern Analysis** across layers
3. **Causal Intervention** to verify circuits

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Implications
Small, specialized judges can effectively pre-filter LLM queries when:
1. Trained on diverse, adversarial data
2. Continuously improved through self-discovery
3. Made interpretable through MI analysis

### 7.2 Limitations
- Requires labeled data for initial training
- Adversarial discovery needs API credits
- May miss entirely novel attack patterns

### 7.3 Future Work
- Extend to more judge types (bias, factuality)
- Investigate judge ensembles
- Apply to multimodal routing

## 8. Conclusion

Guardian-Loop demonstrates that efficient, interpretable judge models can significantly improve AI orchestration systems. By combining adversarial self-improvement with mechanistic interpretability, we create judges that are both robust and understandable. Our integration with Martian shows immediate practical value, reducing costs while improving safety and quality. As AI systems become more complex, interpretable components like Guardian-Loop will be essential for maintaining control and trust.
